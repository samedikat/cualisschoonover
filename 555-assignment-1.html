    <h2>System Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Context</h3>

    <p>
      The HathiTrust Digital Library is a collaborative repository of digitized
      content from research libraries, primarily in the United States. It was
      launched in 2008 by a group of academic and research institutions,
      originally led by the University of Michigan and Indiana University.
      Today, the HathiTrust partnership includes more than 200 member libraries,
      counting The Catholic University of America among their number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its primary goal is to ensure long-term preservation and access to a
      comprehensive body of scholarly materials. Much of its content was
      originally digitized through partnerships with Google Books and the
      Internet Archive, but it is curated and maintained with a strong focus on
      preservation, rights management, and academic usability.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation & Discussion</h2>

    <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open access: Millions of public domain works are fully accessible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extensive content: One of the largest collections of digitized books
        globally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preservation-focused: Strong emphasis on long-term digital preservation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Academic trust: Operated by and for libraries, with transparency and
        scholarly priorities in mind.
      </li>
      <li>Citation help provided, in a limited fashion.</li>
      <li>Links to WorldCat to find material in a library.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Restricted access for copyrighted content: Only bibliographic metadata
        and search snippets are available unless the user is affiliated with a
        partner institution.
      </li>
      <li>
        OCR errors: As with many mass-digitized collections, scanned text may
        contain recognition issues, especially in older or non-Latin script
        materials.
      </li>
      <li>There are no audio/visual files.</li>
      <li>Limited citation formats provided (this is extremely nitpicky).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Expand access options for copyrighted material: More creative licensing,
        controlled digital lending, or fair use-driven access models could make
        more of the collection usable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve OCR quality and metadata enrichment: Expanding efforts to
        correct OCR errors and enhance metadata (e.g., subject headings,
        multilingual support) would benefit all users.
      </li>
    </ul>
